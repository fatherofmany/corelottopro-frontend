        ðŸ”¥ Welcome to the Core Credit Revolution

        <p className="text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-200 text-lg leading-relaxed">
          <strong>Core Credit (Cr)</strong> is the pulse of our gamified social economy built on top of the Coredao Blockchain Network through the Core
          SpinWheel Multi-Currency Gaming Experience! Itâ€™s not just a scoreâ€”itâ€™s your <em>status</em>, <em>influence</em>, and <em>governance access in </em>
           a  pre-tokenized digital ecosystem.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-4 text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-200 text-lg leading-relaxed">
          Cr is the native pre-token economy unit of our entire ecosystem!. While non-tradable at the moment, Cr determines your eligibility to shape,
          own, and benefit from the platform <strong>before</strong> token is launched.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-4 text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-200 text-lg leading-relaxed">
          Every spin, referral, streak, or quest feeds this Cr engine and empowers you!. Your efforts donâ€™t just win prizesâ€”they
          accumulate <strong>power and position</strong>. In a tokenless world, Cr gives early adopters a way to <em> build reputation</em>,
          <em>accrue governance</em>, and <em>unlock future financial upside</em>.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-4 text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-200 text-lg leading-relaxed">
          Youâ€™re not just a playerâ€”youâ€™re a <strong>co-creator of value</strong>. Spin to grow. Refer to rise. Earn Cr and
          <strong> write the rules</strong> before the public even knows whatâ€™s coming.
